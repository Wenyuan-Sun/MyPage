            <h1> What is CAI </h1>
            <p> Computer assisted intervention (CAI), also known as image guided surgery (IGS), is a technology where computer 
              is introduced to to assist surgeons to improve surgical outcomes. After a rapid development in the past two decades, 
              CAI has been widely applied in not only different operations such as orthopedic surgery, maxillofacial surgery, 
              neurosurgery, and so on, but also different stages including pre-, intra-, and post-operation. </p>

            <h1> CAI vs. GPS </h1>
            <p> To understand what CAI means to surgeons, one can refer to the value of GPS for drivers. In order to arrive at 
              the destiny in an unfamiliar place, drivers need the guidance of GPS to determine where the car is and which 
              direction to go. Similarly, with the assistent of CAI, surgeons can accurately locate surgical instruments, 
              patient anatomy, and pre-operative planning in complex surgical scene, which significantly improves surgical 
              accuracy and safety, leading to better surgical outcomes. </p>

            <h1> Advanced Technologies in CAI </h1>
            <p> CAI involves various advanced technologies. First, multi-modality medical imaging systems and their 
              AI-based algorithms are employed to extract extensive information, allowing pre-operative planning, 
              intra-operative perception, and post-operative evaluation. Second, surgicl navigation system relies on 
              registration, localization, tracking, and visualization to ensure accuracy and safety based on sensing, 
              computer vision, graphic rendering, and mixed-reality. Third, surgical robots have been developed for 
              complex surgical scene with high risk, such as spine surgeries, neuro surgeries, and 
              minimal invasive surgeries. </p>

            <h1> Future of CAI </h1>
            <p> In summary, past decades have witnessed the rapid development of CAI, and it is still progressing under the 
              continuous research and investigation of various labs, institutes, and companies around the world. Together with 
              the development of related technologies such as AI, robotics, sensing, and so on, CAI will make more and more 
              contributions to medicine and human health in near future. </p>

            <h1> Intra-operative Image Guidance </h1>
            <p> Intraoperative images provide visual guidance for surgeons, while techniques including calibration, registration, 
              and tracking are required for an accurate surgical navigation. In this on-going project, I focus on fluoroscopy-guided 
              surgeries, studying novel calibration, registration, tracking, and analysis methods for intra-operative fluoroscopic 
              images in order to achieve an accurate surgical avigation.

            <p> It is challenging to recover 3D information from limited 2D information. In this project, I studied how to 
              reconstruct accurate 3D shapes of bones from calibrated biplanar 2D X-ray images by incorporating anatomical prior 
              knowledge to state-of-the-art 3D model reconstruction algorithms.

            <p> Surgical robots have become useful tools to provide surgeons with physical or haptic guidance during operation, 
              increasing accuracy and safty of surgeries. In this project, I developed surgical robotic systems for biopsy and 
              pedicle screw insertion, where experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of these robotic systems. </p>
